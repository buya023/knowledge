##Black Boxes

A subroutine is sometimes said to be a "black box" because you can't see what's "inside" it (or, to be more precise, you usually don't want to see inside it, because then you would have to deal with all the complexity that the subroutine is meant to hide).

// Rules of Black Boxes

1. The interface of a black box should be fairly straightforward, well-defined, and easy to understand.

2. To use a black box, you should not need to know anything about its implementation; all you need to know is its interface.

3. The implementor of a black box should not need to know anything about the larger systems in which the box will be used.
