An important practice is to check the validity of any data set that you analyze. One goal is to detect typos in the data, and another would be to detect faulty measurements. Recall that outliers are observations with values outside the “normal” range of values of the rest of the observations.

1. Specify a large population that you might want to study and describe the type of numeric measurement that you will collect.

I want to study how many times a person blinks her/his eyes per minute. I will collect information from a sample of people. This information is the numbers that a person blinks their eyes per minute. So, my information is a quantitative data type that is presented as numbers. 

2. What would you do if you found a couple of outliers in a sample of size 100? 
First, I will recheck whether they are outliers or not to make sure there is no error in identifying outliers. If there are outliers in the sample data, I will try to find out the reason why there are outliers such as checking whether the person has a medical condition that affects the eyes. After checking and considering the reasons, I will remove the outliers. 
Outliers are “values greater than the third quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range or if they are less than the first quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range” (Yakir, B. 2011).

3. What would you do if you found two values that were twice as big as the next highest value?

There are 100 samples if the first and second highest values are twice as much as the third highest value, so, they are clearly an outlier since it is obviously higher than the third quartile value multiplied by 1.5. These outliers could dramatically change the average and standard deviation. So, I would eliminate these 2 values from the sample data.
