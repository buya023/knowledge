1. 
```prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'
for letter in prefixes:
     print(letter + suffix)```
Put this code into a Python script and run it. Notice that it prints the names "Oack" and "Qack".
Modify the program so that it prints "Ouack" and "Quack" but leaves the other names the same.

## Part1:
```prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'
suffix = 'ack'
for letter in prefixes:
    if letter == 'Q' or letter == 'O':
        print(letter +'u'+ suffix)
    else:
        print(letter + suffix)```

**Output:**
```Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Ouack
Pack
Quack```


## Part 2:
Give at least three examples that show different features of string slices. Describe the feature illustrated by each example. Invent your own examples.  

**Example 1:** Slice a string.
Python slicing is to get substrings from a string by slicing it. An operator is [i,j] that returns starting from i-th index to j-th index. J-th index is not included. Name[0:4] prints from start to 4th letter but the 4th letter is not included. So, only 0,1,2,3 rd letters are printed.

```name= 'Buyanjargal'
print(name[0:4])
print(name[0]+name[-1])
Output:
Buya
Bl```



**Example 2:** Slice a string by skipping a step. 
This example is to find strings that are in even-numbered indexes from 0-index until -2 index. 

```Nums= '123456789'
Nums[:-2:2]

Output: 1357```


**Example 3:** reverse a string using slicing.

```Name='Buyanjargal'
Name[::-1]

Output: lagrajnayuB```


**Example 4:** Create a list of substrings from a string.
The example creates a list that contains substrings from the string named ‘alphabet’.

```alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
listOfAlp=[alphabet[:7], alphabet[7:12],alphabet[12:-12],alphabet[-12],alphabet[-11:]]
A = [“asd”, “ads”]
print(listOfAlp)

Output: ['abcdefg', 'hijkl', 'mn', 'o', 'pqrstuvwxyz']```
