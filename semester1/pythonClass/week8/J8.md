Create an input file with your original three-or-more items and add at least three new items, for a total of at least six items.

**Code:** 
```Tasks={ 'Reading material': 'Done', 'Write Discussion assignment': 'Done', 'Assess 3 peers': 'Not Done', 'Write Programming assignment': 'Not Done', 'Write Journal': 'Doing', 'Self Quiz':'Done' }
 
#inverting a dictionary
def invert_dict(d):
    inverse = dict()
    for key in d:
         val = d[key]
         if val not in inverse:
              inverse[val] = [key]
         else:
              inverse[val].append(key)
    return inverse
 
 
#Converting your dictionary into a text string and save it in a file
f = open('J8/input.txt', 'w')  # open a file to write string into
for key in Tasks.keys():    # loop dictionary to write to file
    f.write(" %s : %s \n" % (key, Tasks[key] ))    # writing into the file
f.close()
   
 
#Converting each input string into a dictionary item.
dictionary = {}
with open( "J8/input.txt" ) as f1 :
    for line in f1:
         (key, value) = line.split(':')
         print(key, value)
         dictionary[key.strip()] = value.strip()
print('\ntext file to dictionary=\n' , dictionary)
 
 
invertedD = invert_dict(dictionary)   # Invert this dictionary
#Writing into a different file in text string format.
with open('J8/output.txt','w') as f3:  # open a 2nd file to write string into
    for key,value in invertedD.items():    # loop dictionary and get key and value
         f3.write('%s : %s \n' % (key,value))    # writing into the file```


Input text contains todo list. Keys are the names of todo, and values are the status. Status can be done, not done, doing. So, after the dictionary conversion, the output dictionary has 3 keys and an array of todos in each status. So, I decided to encode my dictionary as three lines of text. Each line starts with status and colon. After the status, all todos are listed in order.
