### Part1: 
Design the dictionary so that it could be useful for something meaningful to you. Create at least three different items in it. Invent the dictionary yourself. 

```def invert_dict(d):
     inverse = dict()
     for key in d:
          val = d[key]
          if val not in inverse:
               inverse[val] = [key]
          else:
               inverse[val].append(key)
     return inverse

print('Original dictionary:', Tasks )
print('Inverted dictionary:', invert_dict(Tasks))```


Output:
```Original dictionary: {'Reading material': 'Done', 'Write Discussion assignment': 'Done', 'Assess 3 peers': 'Not Done', 'Write Programming assignment': 'Not Done', 'Write Journal': 'Doing', 'Self Quiz': 'Done'}

Inverted dictionary: {'Done': ['Reading material', 'Write Discussion assignment', 'Self Quiz'], 'Not Done': ['Assess 3 peers', 'Write Programming assignment'], 'Doing': ['Write Journal']}```


### Part 2:
Describe what is useful about your dictionary. Then describe whether the inverted dictionary is useful or meaningful, and why:

My original dictionary stores my current tasks and each status of tasks at UoPeople university class. The data could be used to create my calendar and to-do list, where students can look up their tasks and status of each task.

The inverted dictionary is a reversion of the key and value of the original dictionary. If I wanted to see which tasks are done or not done for example, I can use the inverted dictionary. In the above example, there are done tasks in one list and not done tasks are in another list. You could see tasks that are not done in one list.
