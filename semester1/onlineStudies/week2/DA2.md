## Imagine that you have been asked to speak to your classmates and share your most helpful strategy for college-level writing. What would that strategy be?
 

There are two main strategies I follow when I write. 

I think that the most essential step is to take the time to understand a question and brainstorm before writing. I learned the importance of this method while I was preparing for the TOEFL exam. Its writing section is notoriously hard. Test takers have to write around 350 words in 30 minutes. At first, my essay lacked organization and clear direction. So, I started to use the first 7 minutes to understand questions and brainstorm my ideas. So, I was able to write the whole essay in a short time in an organized way. After that, brainstorming and reading the question multiple times became my number one approach to writing any essay. 

I always revise multiple times after writing the assignment. Revising helps to improve my writing and fix grammar errors. For example, when I write my discussion assignments, I always use the Grammarly spell checker. Also, I ask other people to proofread my writing, and get feedback. After improving my writing several times, I am satisfied with my writing and finally uploaded it to a discussion forum. Everyone makes a lot of mistakes while writing. But, it is alright if you take your time to correct your mistakes in the end. 

Thus, I advise you to take time to understand questions and brainstorm. Also, using grammar checkers and asking others to read your writing will help you to improve your writing.

Writing a paper requires more effort than writing a discussion post because writing paper requires more knowledge about that subject. Writing a paper is stating what you believe and position on a particular field. On the other hand, writing a discussion post is sharing their opinions and ideas about a subject and expecting a response about your post from others.(College Success, 2015) Also, I feel that writing papers have to be more formal than writing discussion posts. 

Writing an initial discussion post is like I am giving my opinions about a particular subject. On the other hand, a response post is expected to answer and respond to any feedback from the reviewer.
