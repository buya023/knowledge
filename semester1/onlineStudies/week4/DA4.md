###  1. Having read this week's assigned materials, how would you define critical thinking?
I think critical thinking is a way of finding the best decision without bias and manipulation.  
Also, critical thinking is a core part of many things such as effective communication and creating new creative ideas (Downey, 2015). Critical thinking has a few steps to find a solution by identifying a problem and collecting information for each choice, etc. 
		
Critical thinking is needed during college and in further personal life. The most common example in daily life is making personal decisions such as should I buy a new bag?. When reading assignments from an instructor, trying to learn what the instructor is really asking me to do and what should I add to the assignment? etc. these things are common situations and questions that critical thinking is commonly needed to use during classes in college. 

###   2. Why are employers making these comments? Are they justified – should colleges be responsible for teaching critical thinking? If not, whose job is it?


The survey, from PayScale, Inc and Future Workplace, indicates that 60% of managers say critical thinking/problem solving is the soft skill most lacking among recent college graduates (Starner,  2016). Employers expect that new employers will use critical thinking into solving problems and creating new ideas in their jobs. So, I think that the employer’s comments are justified. College students should have critical thinking to become good employers. But, we can not expect only college professors to teach students. If students lack critical thinking skills, they should learn ways to improve the skill. 
 
Critical thinking is a habit that forms after a significant amount of time for a person. So, I think that critical thinking is not only responsible for colleges teaching their students. Critical thinking should be taught by their parents, and elementary and middle, and high school teachers little by little for children to adjust and learn to use the skill in their daily life before college. So, the students could have good critical thinking habits before they become adults.
