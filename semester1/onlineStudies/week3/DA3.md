### Did any of the information in the Catalog - such as the consequences - surprise you? Why or why not? 
 
There is a thing that is new to me and surprised me after reading the catalog. 
The fact that students are not allowed to publicly share their work completed at UoPeople until two calendar years was very interesting(UoPeople website, 2022). I had thought of starting a new online blog or website about my experience and the new lessons I learned from UoPeople. It was for documenting what I learned as a student at UoPeople. I now realize that it was illegal by the code of academic integrity of UoPeople. I am thinking that I have to postpone it now for at least 2 years. 
 
### Given the potential consequences of plagiarizing, why do you think students engage in plagiarism? Be sure to explore at least two possible reasons why students might plagiarize. 75
 
In my opinion, the main reason is that students choose to plagiarize because of fear of failing in courses. Students are always afraid of taking a course again, which costs them a lot of money and time. When some students think the class is boring, they often procrastinate and wait until the deadline. When some students encounter a 3000-word essay due in 5 hours, I think they are very likely to tempt plagiarism.
Moreover, students forget to give credit to sources they use in their assignments unintentionally. They forget to add references or citing. So, they ended up with name plagiarizing. Students have to be extra careful to include all resources they use. But, references can be very difficult to manage for big projects such as dissertations. 
Finally, students write credits in the wrong way. Universities often accept certain types of formats such as APA. It is well defined for some types of sources such as books, papers, and journals. But, the APA format can be tricky for some types of sources such as Youtube videos, online articles, etc. So, students might reference these things in the wrong way. 
I think the fear of failing in class, forgetting to give credit, or giving wrong credits are the main reasons to plagiarize students.
 
 
### What strategies will you use to avoid plagiarism? 
I will use the following strategies to avoid each of the above 3 cases.
Procrastination
Give enough time for each task so I can come up with my original ideas or give credits to every source correctly
2.  Donâ€™t forget to give credit
Keeping track of courses. I could give specific colors to ideas and opinions from other sources. So, I will know where I need to add references and citations.
